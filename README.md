### Project Title
No-show appointments dataset analysis

### Description
>This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. This data set contain records whether patients miss appointments ot not, information about appointments and attributes of patients.<br>
In this project I am trying to determine if some variables influence the probability of whether or not patient is going to show up to the appointment and what is the correlation between the variables in the dataset.
